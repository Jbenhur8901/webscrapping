Hello, my name is Jacques Benhur ESSISSONGO, I 
am a BSc student in Data Science and certified 
in the Google Data analytics program.
The sole purpose of this project is to make 
available to the community of analysts and 
data scientists, a dataset of customer reviews 
on the largest companies from the Trustpilot 
site in order to perform analysis, build models 
and make recommendations.
This data is very useful as it contains a lot of 
information that can be used in different ways

all the dataset are stored in the zip file.
